# TargetedExogenousCausalKnowledge

This repository contains the code and supplementary materials for the article "Quantifying a Causal Effect from a CPDAG with Targeted Exogenous Causal Knowledge". In this work, we explore methods for accurately quantifying causal effects within the framework of a CPDAG. The focus is leveraging targeted exogenous causal knowledge to refine and enhance causal inference in scenarios where the underlying causal structure is partially known.
